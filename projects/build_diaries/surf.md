# Surboard Build Diary

## Shaping

May 2022, I purchased a "blank" from Sadhana surfboards in Christchurch. This is basically an oversized piece of foam built around a stringer. It needs cutting, shaping and sanding back to your intended surfboard shape. I went through some design options with Alex and we settled on a plan to build a "Performance Longboard" that would still allow me to "Hang Ten" on the off chance I donâ€™t wipe out immediately.

## Graphics

I named my board "Donna Sumner" â€” a playful nod to the queen of disco and my local surf break.

## Glassing

Next up was the scary part, fibre glassing the boards! Alex had experience with shaping on his previous course, but glassing was new to us both. He had a horror story from the first attempt on his own board. Turns out for us amaterurs, it's way easier as a two person job. Even so, you gotta be quick!

## Fin Boxes

Next up was to install the fin boxes. This required a router to cut out the resin and foam. The box is then mounted in place with a second pour.

## Sanding and Polishing

Next up was much sanding and polishing! This work was insanely dusty, so had to be done outside.

## Finished Boards

After many winter evenings work, our boards were finally complete! Such an awesome project resulting in something I'm super proud of and get to keep. Thanks Alex!
