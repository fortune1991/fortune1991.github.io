## V5 - Shipping MVP
Further developed the project so it can now be shipped as an MVP. For this, I've made the following updates:

  - SQL database now stored in the AWS cloud using MySQL and RDS
  - UI upgraded to be based on the Textualize library. Distributed as a Web application, hosted on AWS
  - Data visulations created using Grafana
