# Garden Build Diary

## Moving in

In 2024, we purchased our first home ðŸ˜€ At the time, we didn't really have any short term ambitions for the garden...
You can see on the right handside all of the overgrown trees, agapanthus and foliage.

**Clare started to slowly chip away at some tidying up**

**I started to help and we got carried away..**

**We got some help from our friend Yaz to deal with some of the bigger and persistent trees and stumps**

## New drainage pipes and driveway

We had new drainage pipes installed (old clay to new PVC). We agreed with the neighbour to upgrade the old driveway at the same time.

**We also plan to install a new bike shed. We dug out the foundation ready for fresh concrete**

**There will be an automated irrigation system used to water the new veggie patch. Here I've marked out the pipe route**

**More digging!**

## Soil removal

To make way for the new veggie, there was a fair amount of soil that needed removing from the property. 20 trailer loads in fact! Yaz helped us do the hard yards on this task. Afterwards, we had a tree stump grinder come through to clear the area.

## Prepping for the new driveway

Next, we worked on prepping the area for the new driveway install.

## Building bike sheds and gardening

Next, I worked on building the new bike shed, whilst Clare (finally!) cracked on with the veggie patch.
