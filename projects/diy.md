# DIY

In my spare time, I enjoy getting some good use out of my power tool "investments". Here's a couple of homegrown efforts and creations.

## Garden

**Skills:** Digging, Hard Labour, Teamwork

**Description:** When my girlfriend and I bought our first home in March 2024, we had always planned to do some work in the garden. But we got carried away and this project evolved quicker than we ever imagined! Big thanks to our friend Yaz, who generously helped us fell trees and remove around 20 trailers’ worth of soil from the property!

In the end, we transformed an overgrown patch into a thriving veggie strip of about 25m². Along the way, we refurbished the old fence, installed automated irrigation, got a new driveway surface, and built a bike storage shed.

## Surf Board

</p>

**Skills:** Shaping, Glassing, Graphic Design

**Description:** Props to my friend Alex for this one! After taking a surfboard shaping course with Christchurch company Sadhana, he decided to start making boards from scratch at home. I joined him for the ride and picked up my own blank. What followed was an incredibly fun, messy, sticky, and occasionally stressful journey — full of dust, resin, and fast-setting epoxy!

## Backgammon Board

</p>

**Skills:** Woodworking, Graphic Design, Paiting

**Description:** Custom backgammon board made as a housewarming gift for my girlfriend. I used leftover plywood from the campervan, cutting it into strips, regluing, and planing it back into a board. The backgammon layout was ink-printed onto rice paper and finished with a coat of polyurethane.
