# DIY

In my spare time, I enjoy getting some good use out of my power tool "investments". Here's a couple of homegrown efforts and creations.

## Garden

**Skills:** Digging, Hard Labour, Teamwork

**Description:** When me and my gf brought a house in March 2024, we always had some ambitions to do a bit of work in the garden. We got carried away and this project evolved quicker than we ever imagined! Shouts to our friend Yaz on this one, who made the time to give us a serious helping hand felling trees and removing 20 trailers worth of soil from the property!

In short, we managed to turn an overgrown patch of nothing into a thriving veggie strip of around 25m2. In doing so, we refurbished the tired old fence, installed automated irrigation, got a new driveway installed and built a new bike storage shed.

## Surf Board

</p>

**Skills:** Shaping, Glassing, Graphic Design

**Description:** Shoutouts to my friend Alex on this one! The real instigator of this project. On the back of a surfboard shaping course at Christchurch company, Sahana, he decided he wanted to make some boards start to finish at home. I was able to join him for the ride and also purchased my own "blank". The rest was an incredibly messy, sticky and stressful journey involving lots of dust and fast setting epoxy!

**Description:** Custom backgammon board as a house warming gift for my gf. Made using left over plywood from the campervan. The board layout was ink printed onto rice paper and coated with polyurethane.
