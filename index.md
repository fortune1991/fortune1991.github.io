# About me

I love a project, particularly those that challenge me to solve problems and develop new skills in the process. My journey into computer science began two years ago when I set out to automate some tasks at my previous job. I had long suspected there was a better way than bloated Excel spreadsheets but lacked the coding knowledge to make it happen. Discovering Python opened that door, and I’ve since fallen deep into the rabbit hole.

I came to Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019 for a "one-year" working holiday. Six years later I’m still here, now a proud garden (and home) owner, with short-term ambitions to build a luxury chicken house and extend the garage to make more room for bikes and surfboards.

Outside of work I enjoy building things, both digital and physical, cycling (in all forms), surfing, skiing, woodworking, and beer brewing.

I’m currently on a year-long sabbatical, travelling the world with my wonderful girlfriend. After hiking in the Himalayas, exploring cultural sites in India, and cycling 3,000 km around mainland Europe, our ambitious plan continues as we cycle from Bangkok to Singapore as part of our return journey. We’ll be back in Christchurch in January 2026, when I’ll be looking for new job opportunities.
