# About me

I like building things, both digital and physical, and I’m happiest when I’m working on a project that challenges me to learn new skills. My journey into computer science began two years ago when I set out to automate some tasks at my previous job. I had long suspected there was a better way but lacked the coding knowledge to make it happen. Discovering Python opened that door, and I’ve since fallen deep into the rabbit hole, now taking on projects that continue to expand my knowhow and curiosity.

I came to Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019 for a "one-year" working holiday. Six years later I’m still here, now a proud garden (and home) owner, with short-term ambitions to build a luxury chicken house and extending the garage to make more room for bikes and surfboards...

I’m currently on a year-long sabbatical, travelling the world with my wonderful girlfriend. After hiking in the Himalayas, exploring cultural sites in India, and cycling 3,000 km around mainland Europe, our ambitious plan continues as we cycle from Bangkok to Singapore as part of our return journey. We’ll be back in Christchurch for January 2026, when I’ll be looking for new job opportunities.
