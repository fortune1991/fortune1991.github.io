# About me

I like to build things, both digital and physical. I’m happiest when I'm working on a project that pushes me to learn new skills. My journey into Computer Science began two years ago, when I wanted to automate some tasks at my previous job. For some things, I had long suspected there was a better way, but lacked the coding knowledge to make it happen. Discovering Python opened that door, and I’ve since fallen deep into the rabbit hole, taking on projects that continue to expand my skills and curiosity.
